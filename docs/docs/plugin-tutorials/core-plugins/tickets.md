‚öôÔ∏è Self-hosted client, please go to the <a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/plugins/plugin-installation">plugin installation documentation</a> to instal the card plugin after installing the erxes XOS.

‚Äçüíª  SaaS clients, when you sign-up to erxes Ticket plugin will be there already, so just go along with this guideline to get started with this plugin.  



### CREATE YOUR TICKET MANAGEMENT

The Ticket can be found on the left hand side of the screen when you enter erxes. By selecting the tab you will be able to place the sign on the plugins bar visible.

---

The ticket menu allows you to organize, customize and monitor the way your team customers‚Äô requests and inquiries are viewed and collected on erxes in the following ways.

- Save multiple pipelines on a single Board.
- Pipelines can be customized to your organization‚Äôs needs. Each pipeline can be dedicated to a team within your organization.

:::Info

If your organization does not have many inquiries, creating a single pipeline would be beneficial. As you can organize different deals/tickets in the Label or Properties section of the pipeline, it may be more convenient for similar requests to be on one board. This saves time as it reduces time spent navigating around multiple screens as everything is sorted and funneled into one page.

After setting up this section, you can learn more about how to use this menu effectively in the Ticket menu.


**Step one.** Creating your board and pipeline

- There are 2 ways to create your board 
1. Using the settings option.  
---

- When you‚Äôre creating your pipeline, you have to keep in mind that all businesses are different and require different stages to reach the final stage of each project. Before creating your Ticket stages, please read the blog post that will hopefully help you to set up your Task pipeline effectively. 
---

**Step two.** Add properties on your task pipeline

To customize your Ticket cards, you can create additional fields that fit your unique needs from each card. To add new properties in your Task pipeline card, you‚Äôll need to go to the Property plugin here. 


---

***Step two.*** Create your products and services

The part of tracking your ticket performance, connecting your products and services to your Ticket pipeline is an important step. In order to create your products and services, please go to the Products & services plugin here.

**Step three.** Add campaign on your ticket pipeline

Using Auto Campaigns, you can automate some of your tasks like automatic emails to be sent when you drag a card to a different stage as they progress along your Task pipelines.

---

In this case, let's say a tour agency wants to send a quote for the tour package and some personalized content as an email to the lead associated with this deal card above. You can set up auto emails for each stage, but we'll create segments for the Quote Sent stage for this one. Let's create a parent segment with two subsegments for these different group types:

---

**1: Create Custom Card Properties (Optional)**

Here we are updating the custom card property on the right and then moving the card to the next stage. If you have any differentiating properties, please create those in advance by going to Settings -> Properties - > Deal/Task/Ticker Properties. Also, notice that the card already has a contact associated with it and make sure their email verification status is valid.

**2: Create Card Segments**

Please go to Settings -> Segments -> and choose from the segment type on the left to create these segments.
Parent segment
The parent segment, which is optional, will have the base filters that will be used on all subsegments:
 
---

:::CAUTION
You can set whether the stage is active or archived. To highlight a certain task, configuring age as a duration is an important action.
---



### Subsegments

Once you set up your 'base' parent segment, you can create subsegments where you point the stage name: 


:::CAUTION

To assign ‚Äúsubsegments‚Äù, create and save the segments first.

---

**3: Create an Auto Campaign Email**

---

Once you create your segments, please select one stage segment in the Campaign target selection slide:


### Segment


The number of customers found in the segment will likely be 0 when you're creating the Campaign. Not to worry, that means that nobody moved a card exactly 15 minutes ago to this stage.

### Schedule

On the next slide, please set the schedule as every minute:


---

:::CAUTION

Make sure you choose the right time filter for the parent segment. If you don't set that timeframe, but your Campaign schedule is set as every minute, you might end up spamming your contacts every minute.
Note that if you're not using erxes SaaS with your own AWS SES account, these auto emails will be sent to contacts with only valid email verification statuses on the erxes database. Please refer to this guide on how to verify your email addresses. If you connect your own AWS SES account, the restriction can be updated.

ü•≥ Congratulations, you have successfully set up your Ticket Pipeline. Now, let‚Äôs start using it.
