### With Campaign, you can do...

Campaigns are marketing, sales & support projects that allow you to generate new business from your existing customers, leads (sales prospects), or guide the existing clients. Campaigns allow you to track the campaign budget, the number of customers or potential customers (leads), their responses, and the number of open sales.

**Step One:** Create your brand

**Step two**. Create the campaign
 
1. Plan your campaign

This sounds simple enough but usually requires the most amount of thought. What are your campaign goals? Do you want to increase lead generation, send out a lot of holiday cards, promote a new product or service, publicize a webinar, or just stay in touch with your inactive customers?

2. Determine how to target the campaign

There are four main groups you will want to target: existing customers, prospective customers (leads), visitors, team members, or a combination of all. The goal of the campaign will determine which group you target. erxes allows for easy creation of lists based on the target group and any criteria you choose, such as industry, geography, or title.

Once you have determined the target groups, you can use the standard and custom fields on the <a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/plugin-tutorials/core-plugins/segment">**Segment**</a> plugin to track this information. 

3. Execute the campaign 

Now that you have determined the target, it is time to execute the campaign.

4. Track responses

Before tracking responses, you will need to determine what responses you require. You can regularly track your responses through 3 kinds: auto, visitor auto, manual, and all statuses: live, draft, and paused.

- If your campaign points the recipient to your web page, you can set up a web-to-lead form on your page that customers can fill out. Then you can track all the triggered events to the number of forms filled out. 
- They are then automatically created as a lead and added to the campaign of your choice. This is the easiest way to track responses as it is automatic. This is how you can track your manual campaign responses. 
- If you tracking your new customer onboarding sequins, you may have to check the software renewal percentage as well as the numbers of your customer inquiry. 

---

- If your responses come in individually, like phone calls or emails, you can manually create the new lead and then manually associate it to the proper campaign or update the status of a pre-existing campaign member. This can be the most time-consuming, so you may want to look at mass uploading or mass updating.


5. Analyze campaign effectiveness

Right on the campaign detail page, you can track the total sent and responded, the total contacts and leads, the number of converted leads, the totally open and won opportunities, and the total value of open and won opportunities.

If the campaign is a parent in a campaign hierarchy, you can also see the above statistics for all child campaigns on the parent campaign page.

erxes also includes standard campaign reports such as email analysis, customer response, and more. These can be customized to fit your needs, and after customization, they can be used for campaign dashboards that can tell you at a glance how all of your campaigns are doing and how they stack up against each other.
