## Server Installation

erxes gives you several guides and options for installing the erxes platform.

The first guide is the [Quick Start](ubuntu-quickstart.mdx) installation guide where we provide a script that automates most of the installation process. The second guide is a comprehensive, [Step by Step](ubuntu-step-by-step.mdx) installation guide where developers can see exactly what is being installed and how. The **Step by Step** installation guide is also used where heavy resources are needed when using erxes. Additional components are installed during the **Step by Step** installation.

Most users will find the **Quick start** installation to be more than sufficient. You can always upgrade at any time.

:::info Ubuntu 18.04
The two installation guides are for installing erxes on **Ubuntu 18.04**. They should work on any hosting provider that allows you to install Ubuntu 18.04.

**Ubuntu 18.04** is currently the only officially supported **Linux distro**. Other distros such as _Centos and Debian are not specifically supported_, but some users are able to adapt the below commands to make **erxes** work on them.
