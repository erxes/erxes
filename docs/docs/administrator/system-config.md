### Google

Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Firebase, Gmail and Pubsub. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.

Following steps explain the Google Cloud Project. Which allows us to use Google Cloud Platform's services to our Erxes app.

- Create a Google Cloud Project [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Click on the Select Project

- Enter project name and click on the Create button

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-3.png)

#### Service account

- Navigate to sidebar IAM & Admin => Service Accounts

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-4.png)

- Now let's create service account for our app

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-5.png)

- Enter service account name and description then click on the Create button

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-6.png)

- Select Owner role and click on the Continue button

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-7.png)

- Create key for service account, you will download json file automatically and keep it

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-8.png)

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-9.png)

- Successfully created service account

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-10.png)

* Copy the service account file's content to google_cred.json in **erxes-api/google_cred.json.sample**, **erxes-integrations/google_cred.json.sample**, and rename them to **google_cred.json**

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-11.png)

- One last touch, we need to configure erxes, Go to Settings => System Config => General System config
  And configure **GOOGLE PROJECT ID**, **GOOGLE APPLICATION CREDENTIALS** fields as in the sceenshot

  - **GOOGLE APPLICATION CREDENTIALS** is google_cred file's path by default it's ./google_cred.json no need to change
  - **GOOGLE APPLICATION CREDENTIALS JSON** is google_cred (service account) file's content for **Firebase** configuration

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/integration/google/google-general-12.png)
