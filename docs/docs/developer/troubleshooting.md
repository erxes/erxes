## Nylas Gmail IMAP

If you encounter **Invalid authentication or incorrect username password** when you create Gmail IMAP integration, Please check the following
- Ensure that you entered the correct password
- Ensure that you enabled the IMAP Access in [Gmail config](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general)
- Ensure that you turned on the [Less secure app](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) on your personal email address. If you're using GSuite, click [here](https://admin.google.com/u/5/ac/security/lsa) to go to your Google Admin console and allow users to manage their access to less secure apps.

If you don't know how to configure these, please go ahead to Gmail IMAP doc section [here](https://www.erxes.org/administrator/system-config/#gmail-imap)

## Gmail
* Before you use Gmail integration please make sure that you enter correct GOOGLE TOPIC, GOOGLE GMAIL SUBSCRIPTION NAME it should be single string otherwise you will get invalid_format error.

* Permission Denied, when creating or checking Google Topic and Subscription make sure your service account has owner role in IAM & Admin -> IAM.

* If you are not receiving any emails, please check you add Grant Publish Topic right to **gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com** in IAM & Admin -> IAM -> Add.

* When the Integration repository starts it will automatically create a topic and subscription for syncing, receiving emails. But if you have not configured your system environment you might see the following error - [ Google Cloud Getting started ](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

```

* When your Gmail's topic and subscription is not created automatically and got the following error:

**Error Sending test Message to Cloud PubSub projects topics/gmail_topic: Resource not found (resource=topic)**

Please make sure that you added an **absolute** path in **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**.
