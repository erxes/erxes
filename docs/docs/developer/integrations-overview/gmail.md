Read and send messages, manage drafts and attachments, search threads and messages, work with labels, setup push notifications, and manage Gmail settings.

Setting up the Gmail is easy with the script we made. You will see gmail-script.sh file in your integrations repo.

First, you need to have [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) on your computer.
Now let's make it executable. In your terminal run the following command <br/>

`chmod +x gmail-setup.sh`

Run script as follows <br/>

`./gmail-setup.sh`

This script basically will do most of the things for you. However there are a few steps you will have to make manually. When you successfully run the script it will show the rest of the steps.
