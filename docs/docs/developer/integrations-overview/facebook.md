Erxes app can be integrated with facebook developer API and that means we can receive our Facebook pages' inbox messages and posts directly to our erxes app's inbox. With the help of Facebook developer API we have many more possibilities, like receiving notifications about page comment, page post feed etc. There is an active development process going on this subject.

<!-- #### Requirements:

- Working sub domain with SSL pointing to your erxes-api server.
