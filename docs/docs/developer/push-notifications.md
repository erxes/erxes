Push Notifications are an important feature to retain and re-engage users and monetize on their attention. We use Firebase's cloud messaging feature as a push notification service. In order to use this feature, you will need a firebase project.

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Go to Google Cloud Platform and generate service account config file and download.
3. Replace the values of **google_credentials.json.sample** with your downloaded service account file and rename it to **google_credentials.json**
