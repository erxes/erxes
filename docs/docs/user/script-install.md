#### Step 3: If you want to get user information automatically, you can insert additional field under `brand_id` in your messenger script. Insert the messenger script in your web body section. :

```
<script>
  window.erxesSettings = {
    messenger: {
      brand_id: "sNbKdZ",
      email: 'email1111@yahoo.com',
      phone: '88833331111',
      data: {
        avatar: 'https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/female-avatars-vol-1/256/female-portrait-avatar-profile-woman-sexy-afro-2-512.png',
        firstName: 'firstName1111',
        lastName: 'lastName1111',
        birthDate: new Date('2020-01-01'),
        sex: 1,
        emailValidationStatus: 'valid',
        position: 'position',
        department: 'department',
        leadStatus: 'working',
        hasAuthority: 'Yes',
        description: 'bio',
        doNotDisturb: 'Yes',
        code: 'id',
        'links.linkedIn': 'http://linkedin.com/test',
        'links.twitter': 'http://twitter.com/test',
        'links.facebook': 'http://facebook.com/test',
        'links.github': 'http://github.com/test',
        'links.youtube': 'http://youtube.com/test',
        'links.website': 'http://website.com/test',

        // custom fields ===========
       // createdAt is reserved field
        updatePlan: new Date('2020-04-25'),
        plan: 'paid',
      },
      companyData: {
        name: 'name',
        'links.website': 'http://website.com',
      },
    },
  };

(function() {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = "http://localhost:3200/build/messengerWidget.bundle.js";
  script.async = true;
  var entry = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  entry.parentNode.insertBefore(script, entry);
})();

</script>

```

#### Step 4: As you can see the user details, all value will be automatically displayed on each field on user profile.

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/advancedsetup/trackeddata.png)

#### Step 5: Check the custom fields value, it is shown on Tracked data field on left down side.

(see the bellow figure).

```
       // custom fields ===========
       // createdAt is reserved field
        updatePlan: new Date('2020-04-25'),
        plan: 'paid',
```

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/advancedsetup/trackeddata1.png)

#### Step 6: Check the companyData value, it is shown on Companied field on upper right side.

(see the above figure).

```
companyData: {
        name: 'name',
        'links.website': 'http://website.com',
      },
```

If you want to get any data of your Web app automatically. You can just write in your source code inside the data section. It will be shown on TRACKED DATA section.

### Manipulate your messenger function

A messenger can be launched programmatically on some user interaction, "like clicking on request for help button". Rather than attaching to document, there should be an option to attach the erxes launcher to a specific element, as it causes the problem in single-page apps since it is not ideal to display the launcher icon in every page.You are now able to manipulate your messenger functions such as change the appearance of a messenger style, a position as well as you can set up the button on your website to call the messenger on specified page.

#### Button submit

Ability to call submit from outside (parent website), which means listen for callSubmit action from outside to force submit action. For example, you can add any button to call action to open your messenger. There is a window.Erxes.showMessenger() function available on the window object. You can use this function to show messenger programmatically. Insert the following script inside your messenger script code.

```
 document.getElementById('button').onclick = () => {
    window.Erxes.showMessenger()
  }
```

First you need uncheck show launcher check to hide default handler. When you check show launcher, the widget section will invisible but you can still callSubmit action to get messenger.

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/advancedsetup/manipulate1.png)

Insert the following script inside your messenger script code.

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/advancedsetup/manipulate2.png)

Once you click submit button on your website, messenger will open.

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/advancedsetup/manipulate.png)

#### Messenger position

As part of the support system inside the web, it is always difficult to fix the position of launcher icon to the bottom, or right left position, especially on mobile, since it overlaps with other elements, especially bottom navbar.

You can manipulate the position of the messenger body like following. The messenger is show left side of your website.

```
<script>
  window.erxesSettings = {
    messenger: {
      brand_id: "AtaT4Z",
      css: `
          .erxes-messenger {
          left: 8px;
          transform-origin: 0% 100%;
          }

          .erxes-launcher {
          left: 8px;
          right: auto;
          }
          `
          },
  };

(function() {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = "http://localhost:3200/build/messengerWidget.bundle.js";
  script.async = true;
  var entry = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  entry.parentNode.insertBefore(script, entry);
})();

</script>
```

#### CSS style

Ability to change form css from parent. In some cases, the developer wants to hide form title, button or modify some auto-generated CSS. Refer the following example of css file.

```
.erxes-embed-iframe {
margin-top: 100px !important;
margin-bottom: 100px !important;
height: 500px !important;
}

#erxes-messenger-container {
left: 0;
}

#erxes-messenger-iframe {
left: 24px;
}

#erxes-messenger-container:after {
left: -300px;

## Google Tag Manager Troubleshooting guide

If you have any problems with when installing Google Tag Manager script on specified pages, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take to check things are set up correctly.
This instruction covers the case that **all web pages contain the messenger and only some specified page contains pop-up script.** Therefore, it is possible to work on other cases, just change the erxes scripts. Following instruction shows how to arrange the erxes scripts on your web pages.

In order to install two script codes on your page, you need to set some triggers on Google tag manager html code.

### Configure trigger on Messenger script:

1. Add trigger on messenger script code in html which you have already configured in Google tag manager.
2. Configure a trigger that messenger does not contains your specified page. In this case, messenger script would be configured on another tag. It is referred to next paragraph for Configure trigger on Messenger + Pop-Up script.

- Trigger Type: **Page View**
- This trigger fires on: **Some page Views**
- Fire this trigger condition should be: **Page URL does not contain your specified page such as (index/index/category/printers** (See the following figure)

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/GMT+troubleshooting/1.png)

3. Then go to tags and selects the trigger that you configured. (See the following figure)

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/GMT+troubleshooting/2.png)

### Configure trigger on Messenger + Pop-Up script:

While messenger script does not contain specified page as above case, you need to configure messenger script with Pop-Ups script. Figure out the following steps.

1. For google tag manager code, you have to paste scripts of both Messenger and Pop-Ups code. (See the following figure)

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/GMT+troubleshooting/3.png)

2. Add trigger on the html code. The code trigger condition contains your specified page.

- Trigger Type: **Page View**
- This trigger fires on: **Some page Views**
- Fire this trigger condition should be: **Page URL contains your specified page such as (index/index/category/printers)** (See the following figure).

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/GMT+troubleshooting/4.png)

4. Then go to tags and selects the trigger that you configured (See the following figure).

![](https://erxes-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/script-installation/GMT+troubleshooting/6.png)

5. See the figure for Google tag script with trigger configuration.
