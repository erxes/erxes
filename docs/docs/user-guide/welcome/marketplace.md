Your next step would be going to erxes the Marketplace to choose the plugins of your choice.

erxes **<a href="https://erxes.io/marketplace">Marketplace</a>** is where you can learn about all of the plugins erxes provides and how they can help you to create your unique experience.

Plugins are the features that can work independently to fulfill the particular purpose of enterprises/developers, such as sales pipeline, delivery, etc. We have 30+ plugins available on our marketplace right now, and more plugins will be added daily.

You can also develop your own plugins and place them on **<a href="https://erxes.io/marketplace">our Marketplace</a>**. So, that can increase the source of your revenue.

The plugins are divided into the following categories:

- **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/user-guide/plugins/intro-plugins" >Plugins</a>** the features that can work independently to fulfill a particular purpose.
- **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/user-guide/adds-on/intro-addon" >Add-ons</a>** are the sub-features/integrations that can work with plugins to enhance their experience.
- **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/user-guide/services/intro-service" >Services</a>** include all services related to creating your unique experiences with erxes.
- **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/user-guide/power-ups/intro-powerup" >Power-up</a>** is the boost to power up plugins. The most of the power-ups applied for SaaS clients as we set the certian use limits for some of the plugins require extra data regarding its usage.

Each plugin available at Marketplace has;

- dependent plugins, which can not work without them,

You will see many use cases of each plugin that can help you learn what you can do with a combination of different plugins **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/category/use-cases" >here</a>**. 

When you get access to the Marketplace from organizations in different versions, there will be the slight difference regarding the actions can be taken by you, which are:

- **Self-hosted version** You can install the plugins straight from each plugin.
