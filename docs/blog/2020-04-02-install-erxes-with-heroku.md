## **How to install**

1.  Please head to [https://erxes.org/installation/heroku](https://erxes.org/installation/heroku) and follow the guide.
2.  Make sure you have your Heroku account details ready. If not, [create a Heroku account](https://id.heroku.com/login) to get started.
3.  Once you have created erxes apps on Heroku, you will just need to update all the config vars.

That’s it! You’re ready to start using erxes.

With our launch on Heroku, we hope our combined community of developers can experience the value of erxes with a simple deployment on Heroku’s scalable cloud platform.
