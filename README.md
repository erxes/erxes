## What does erxes mean? How do you pronounce it?

erxes (pronounced 'erk-sis') is a Mongolian word meaning “galaxy”. A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. It is branded as “erxes” with all lowercase letters.

## Deploying to Vercel

You can deploy the Next.js apps to Vercel individually:

- client-portal: contains `vercel.json` configured for static export (`out/`).
- exm: contains `vercel.json` configured for static export (`out/`).
- web-call: contains `vercel.json` configured for standard Next.js hosting.

Steps:

1. Install dependencies for the app you want to deploy (example for web-call):
   - `cd web-call && yarn install`
2. Push the repository to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and import the app directory in Vercel.
3. In Vercel project settings, set Framework Preset to Next.js (auto-detected) and keep the default Build Command (`yarn build`).
4. For `client-portal` and `exm`, Output Directory is `out` (auto from `vercel.json`). For `web-call`, no output directory override is needed.
5. Ensure Node.js version is 18.x. A `.node-version` file is provided in each app directory.

Environment variables: configure any required variables in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables. Re-deploy after changes.
