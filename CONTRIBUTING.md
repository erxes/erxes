## Workflow

**Branches**

All changes should be part of a branch and submitted as a pull request - your branches should be prefixed with one of:

- fix/ for bug fixes
- feat/ for features
- docs/ for documentation changes

**Commits**

Strive towards keeping your commits small and isolated - this helps the reviewer understand what is going on and makes it easier to process your requests.

**Pull Requests**

Once your changes are ready, you must submit your branch as a pull request. Your pull request should be opened against the development branch in the main erxes repo.

In your PR's description, you should follow the structure:

- What - what changes are in this PR
- Why - why are these changes relevant
- How - how have the changes been implemented
- Testing - how have the changes been tested or how can the reviewer test the feature

We highly encourage that you do a self-review prior to requesting a review. To do a self-review click the review button in the top right corner, go through your code and annotate your changes. This makes it easier for the reviewer to process your PR.

**Merge Style**

All pull requests are squashed and merged.

**Testing**

All PRs should include tests for the changes that are included. We have two types of tests that must be written:

- Unit tests found under packages/_/src/services/**tests** and packages/_/src/api/routes/\*/**tests**
- Integration tests found in integration-tests/\*/**tests**

## Documentation

- We generally encourage to document your changes through comments in your code.
- If you alter user-facing behavior, you must provide documentation for such changes.
- All methods and endpoints should be documented using <a href="https://jsdoc.app/" target="_blank">JSDoc</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-inline" target="_blank">swagger-inline</a>.
- Afterwars, if you're contributing to our documentation about changes you made to erxes codebase make sure to also check out <a href="https://docs.erxes.io/" target="_blank">the contribution guidelines on our documentation website.</a>

## Release

The erxes team will regularly create releases from the develop branch.
